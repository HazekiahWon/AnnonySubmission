So, the total amount paid to the employees in May is 40 * $15 * 40 = $2400.\nIn June, 1/4 of the employees' contracts expired, so 1/4 * 40 = 10 employees' contracts expired.\nThe remaining employees in June are 40 - 10 = 30 employees.\nThe company still pays each employee $15 per hour for a 40-hour workweek, so the total amount paid to the employees in June is 30 * $15 * 40 = $1800.\nTherefore, the total amount of money the company paid to the employees in the two months is $2400 + $1800 = $4200.\nThe answer is 4200\nSorry, the above solution may be incorrect. It's better to write a program.\n```python\n# define the variables\nemployees_may = 40\nwage_per_hour = 15\nwork_hours_per_week = 40\nweeks_in_june = 4\n\n# calculate the total amount paid in May\ntotal_may = employees_may * wage_per_hour * work_hours_per_week\n\n# calculate the number of employees in June\nemployees_june = employees_may * (1 - 1/4)\n\n# calculate the total amount paid in June\ntotal_june = employees_june * wage_per_hour * work_hours_per_week * weeks_in_june\n\n# calculate the total amount paid in two months\ntotal = total_may + total_june\n\nprint(total)\n```"]}
