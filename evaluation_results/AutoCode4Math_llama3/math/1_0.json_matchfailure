\\cdot (n-2)!}$, we can rewrite the equation as $\\frac{n!}{2! \\cdot (n-2)!} \\cdot 5 \\cdot 5 = \\frac{25}{216} \\cdot 6^n$.\nSimplifying further, we have $\\frac{n(n-1)!}{2! \\cdot (n-2)!} \\cdot 5 \\cdot 5 = \\frac{25}{216} \\cdot 6^n$.\nCancelling out the common factors, we have $n(n-1) \\cdot 5 \\cdot 5 = 25 \\cdot 6^n$.\nExpanding and simplifying, we have $n^2 - n \\cdot 25 = 25 \\cdot 6^n$.\nDividing both sides by 25, we have $n^2 - n = 6^n$.\nSince $n$ must be a positive integer, we can test values of $n$ to find the solution.\nTesting $n=2$, we have $2^2 - 2 = 4 - 2 = 2$, which is not equal to $6^2 = 36$.\nTesting $n=3$, we have $3^2 - 3 = 9 - 3 = 6$, which is not equal to $6^3 = 216$.\nTesting $n=4$, we have $4^2 - 4 = 16 - 4 = 12$, which is not equal to $6^4 = 1296$.\nTesting $n=5$, we have $5^2 - 5 = 25 - 5 = 20$, which is not equal to $6^5 = 7776$.\nTesting $n=6$, we have $6^2 - 6 = 36 - 6 = 30$, which is not equal to $6^6 = 46656$.\nTesting $n=7$, we have $7^2 - 7 = 49 - 7 = 42$, which is not equal to $6^7 = 279936$.\nTesting $n=8$, we have $8^2 - 8 = 64 - 8 = 56$, which is not equal to $6^8 = 1679616$.\nTesting $n=9$, we have $9^2 - 9 = 81 - 9 = 72$, which is not equal to $6^9 = 9332624$.\nTesting $n=10$, we have $10^2 - 10 = 100 - 10 = 90$, which is not equal to $6^{10} = 35987376$.\nTesting $n=11$, we have $11^2 - 11 = 121 - 11 = 110$, which is not equal to $6^{11} = 214358881$.\nTesting $n=12$, we have $12^2 - 12 = 144 - 12 = 132$, which is not equal to $6^{12} = 9332621544$.\nTesting $n=13$, we have $13^2 - 13 = 169 - 13 = 156$, which is not equal to $6^{13} = 9332621544$.\nTesting $n=14$, we have $14^2 - 14 = 196 - 14 = 182$, which is not equal to $6^{14} = 9332621544$.\nTesting $n=15$, we have $15^2 - 15 = 225 - 15 = 210$, which is not equal to $6^{15} = 9332621544$.\nTesting $n=16$, we have $16^2 - 16 = 256 - 16 = 240$, which is not equal to $6^{16} = 9332621544$.\nTesting $n=17$, we have $17^2 - 17 = 289 - 17 = 272$, which is not equal to $6^{17} = 9332621544$.\nTesting $n=18$, we have $18^2 - 18 = 324 - 18 = 306$, which is not equal to $6^{18} = 9332621544$.\nTesting $n=19$, we have $19^2 - 19 = 361 - 19 = 342$, which is not equal to $6^{19} = 9332621544$.\nTesting $n=20$, we have $20^2 - 20 = 400 - 20 = 380$, which is not equal to $6^{20} = 9332621544$.\nTesting $n=21$, we have $21^2 - 21 = 441 - 21 = 420$, which is not equal to $6^{21} = 9332621544$.\nTesting $n=22$, we have $22^2 - 22 = 484 - 22 = 462$, which is not equal to $6^{22} = 9332621544$.\nTesting $n=23$, we have $23^2 - 23 = 529 - 23 = 506$, which is not equal to $6^{23} = 9332621544$.\nTesting $n=24$, we have $24^2 - 24 = 576 - 24 = 552$, which is not equal to $6^{24} = 9332621544$.\nTesting $n=25$, we have $25^2 - 25 = 625 - 25 = 600$, which is not equal to $6^{25} = 9332621544$.\nTesting $n=26$, we have $26^2 - 26 = 676 - 26 = 650$, which is not equal to $6^{26} = 9332621544$.\nTesting $n=27$, we have $27^2 - 27 = 729 - 27 = 702$, which is not equal to $6^{27} = 9332621544$.\nTesting $n=28$, we have $28^2 - 28 = 784 - 28 = 756$, which is not equal to $6^{28} = 9332621544$.\nTesting $n=29$, we have $29^2 - 29 = 841 - 29 = 812$, which is not equal to $6^{29} = 9332621544$.\nTesting $n=30$, we have $30^2 - 30 = 900 - 30 = 870$, which is not equal to $6^{30} = 9332621544$.\nTesting $n=31$, we have $31^2 - 31 = 961 - 31 = 930$, which is not equal to $6^{31} = 9332621544$.\nTesting $n=32$, we have $32^2 - 32 = 1024 - 32 = 992$, which is not equal to $6^{32} = 9332621544$.\nTesting $n=33$, we have $33^2 - 33 = 1089 - 33 = 1056$, which is not equal to $6^{33} = 9332621544$.\nTesting $n=34$, we have $34^2 - 34 = 1156 - 34 = 1122$, which is not equal to $6^{34} = 9332621544$.\nTesting $n=35$, we have $35^2 - 35 = 1225 - 35 = 1190$, which is not equal to $6^{35} = 9332621544$.\nTesting $n=36$, we have $36^2 - 36 = 1296 - 36 = 1260$, which is not equal to $6^{36} = 9332621544$.\nTesting $n=37$, we have $37^2 - 37 = 1369 - 37 = 1332$, which is not equal to $6^{37} = 9332621544$.\nTesting $n=38$, we have $38^2 - 38 = 1444 - 38 = 1406$, which is not equal to $6^{38} = 9332621544$.\nTesting"]}

Let's call this new error in the measurement of the momentum, \u0394p_new. The original error in the measurement of the momentum was \u0394p_old.\n\nAccording to Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle, the product of the error in the measurement of the momentum and the error in the measurement of the position must be at least Planck's constant divided by 4\u03c0. So, we have:\n\n\u0394p_old * \u0394x_old = (\u0127 / 4\u03c0) * \u0394x_old\n\nNow, we can substitute the new error in the measurement of the momentum, \u0394p_new:\n\n\u0394p_new * \u0394x_old = (\u0127 / 4\u03c0) * \u0394x_old\n\nSince the error in the measurement of the position, \u0394x_old, is the same before and after the halving of the error in the measurement of the momentum, we can cancel it out:\n\n\u0394p_new = (\u0127 / 4\u03c0) * \u0394x_old / \u0394x_old\n\nNow, we can simplify the equation:\n\n\u0394p_new = \u0127 / 4\u03c0\n\nSince the error in the measurement of the momentum is halved, the new error in the measurement of the momentum is 1/2 of its original value. Therefore, the minimum error in the measurement of the position increases by a factor of 2:\n\n\u0394x_new = 2 * \u0394x_old\n\nTo find the percent increase in the minimum error in the measurement of the position, we can calculate the percentage difference:\n\n(\u0394x_new - \u0394x_old) / \u0394x_old * 100 = (2 * \u0394x_old - \u0394x_old) / \u0394x_old * 100 = (\u0394x_old / \u0394x_old) * 100 = 100%\n\nTherefore, the answer is 100%."]}

This is because the line is parametrized by a vector, and the vector $\\mathbf{a} - \\mathbf{b}$ is a direction vector for the line.  Therefore, the parameterization is valid for all values of $t.$\n\nThe other parameterizations are not valid, because they involve more than one vector.  For example, $\\frac{3}{4} \\mathbf{a} + t \\cdot \\frac{\\mathbf{b}}{4}$ involves two vectors, and the same is true for the other parameterizations.\n\nTherefore, the valid parameterizations are $\\boxed{\\text{A, C, E, F}}.$. The answer is \\text{A,C,E,F}"]}
