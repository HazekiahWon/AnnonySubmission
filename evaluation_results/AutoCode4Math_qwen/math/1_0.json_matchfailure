If $x$ is even, then $P$ is even, so $2$ can be a divisor of $P$. If $x$ is odd, then $P$ is odd, so $2$ cannot be a divisor of $P$. Therefore, statement (a) is true.\n\nNow let's consider statement (b). If $x$ is even, then $P$ is even, so $2$ must be a divisor of $P$. If $x$ is odd, then $P$ is odd, so $2$ cannot be a divisor of $P$. Therefore, statement (b) is true.\n\nNext, let's look at statement (c). If $x$ is a multiple of $3$, then $P$ is a multiple of $3$, so $3$ can be a divisor of $P$. If $x$ is not a multiple of $3$, then $P$ is not a multiple of $3$, so $3$ cannot be a divisor of $P$. Therefore, statement (c) is true.\n\nNow let's consider statement (d). If $x$ is a multiple of $3$, then $P$ is a multiple of $3$, so $3$ must be a divisor of $P$.

Therefore, statement (e) is true.\n\nFinally, let's consider statement (f). If $x$ is a multiple of $4$, then $P$ is a multiple of $4$, so $4$ must be a divisor of $P$. If $x$ is not a multiple of $4$, then $P$ is not a multiple of $4$, so $4$ cannot be a divisor of $P$. Therefore, statement (f) is true.\n\nIn conclusion, all of the statements are true.

It's better to simply reason step by step.\nLet $w = \\frac{z_3 - z_1}{z_2 - z_1} \\cdot \\frac{z - z_2}{z - z_3}$. Since $w$ is real, it follows that $w = \\overline{w}$, where $\\overline{w}$ denotes the complex conjugate of $w$. We have that\n\\begin{align*}\nw &= \\frac{z_3 - z_1}{z_2 - z_1} \\cdot \\frac{z - z_2}{z - z_3} \\\\\n\\overline{w} &= \\frac{\\overline{z_3 - z_1}}{\\overline{z_2 - z_1}} \\cdot \\frac{\\overline{z - z_2}}{\\overline{z - z_3}} \\\\\n&= \\frac{\\overline{z_3} - \\overline{z_1}}{\\overline{z_2} - \\overline{z_1}} \\cdot \\frac{\\overline{z} - \\overline{z_2}}{\\overline{z} - \\overline{z_3}}.\n\\end{align*}Thus,\n\\[\\frac{z_3 - z_1}{z_2 - z_1} \\cdot \\frac{z - z_2}{z - z_3} = \\frac{\\overline{z_3} - \\overline{z_1}}{\\overline{z_2} - \\overline{z_1}} \\cdot \\frac{\\overline{z} - \\overline{z_2}}{\\overline{z} - \\overline{z_3}}.\\]Expanding both sides, we get\n\\[(z_3 - z_1)(z - z_2)(\\overline{z} - \\overline{z_2})(\\overline{z_3} - \\overline{z_1}) = (z_2 - z_1)(z - z_3)(\\overline{z} - \\overline{z_3})(\\overline{z_2} - \\overline{z_1}).\\]Since the imaginary part of $z$ is the greatest possible, the imaginary part of $\\overline{z}$ is the least possible. This means that the imaginary part of $\\overline{z} - \\overline{z_2}$ is the least possible, so the imaginary part of $\\overline{z} - \\overline{z_3}$ is also the least possible. Therefore, the imaginary part of $z - z_3$ is the greatest possible, so the imaginary part of $z - z_2$ is also the greatest possible. This means that the imaginary part of $z$ is the greatest possible, so the imaginary part of $z$ is $\\boxed{99}$.\n\nTherefore, the real part of $z$ is $\\boxed{42}$.\nThe answer is 42"]}

It's better to simply reason step by step.\nSince $p(x)$ has rational coefficients, the radical conjugate of $\\sqrt{7}$ must also be a root of $p(x)$.  Thus, the other root of $p(x)$ is $\\sqrt{7}$.  By Vieta's formulas, the sum of the roots of $p(x)$ is $-\\frac{b}{a}$.  Since the sum of the roots is $\\sqrt{7} + \\sqrt{11}$, we have \\[\\sqrt{7} + \\sqrt{11} = -\\frac{b}{a}.\\]Squaring both sides, we get \\[7 + 2\\sqrt{77} + 11 = \\frac{b^2}{a^2},\\]so $18 + 2\\sqrt{77} = \\frac{b^2}{a^2}$.  Since $p(\\sqrt{7}) = 22$, we have \\[a(\\sqrt{7})^2 + b(\\sqrt{7}) + c = 22,\\]so $7a + \\sqrt{7}b + c = 22$.  Since $p(\\sqrt{11}) = 30$, we have \\[a(\\sqrt{11})^2 + b(\\sqrt{11}) + c = 30,\\]so $11a + \\sqrt{11}b + c = 30$.  Subtracting these equations, we get \\[4a + (\\sqrt{11} - \\sqrt{7})b = 8,\\]so $4a + \\sqrt{77}b = 8$.  Since $18 + 2\\sqrt{77} = \\frac{b^2}{a^2}$, we have $4a + \\sqrt{77}b = 8$.  Solving this system of equations, we find $a = 1$, $b = -2$, and $c = 16$.  Therefore, \\[p(\\sqrt{17}) = (\\sqrt{17})^2 - 2(\\sqrt{17}) + 16 = \\boxed{30}.\\]\nThe answer is 30"]}
