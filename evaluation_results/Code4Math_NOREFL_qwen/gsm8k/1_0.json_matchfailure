This means that there must be some cows on the farm.\nSince cows have 4 legs each, we can subtract the number of legs from the chickens from the total number of legs to find the number of legs from the cows.\n70 - 40 = 30\nSince each cow has 4 legs, we can divide the number of legs from the cows by 4 to find the number of cows.\n30 / 4 = 7.5\nHowever, we cannot have half a cow, so we know that our initial assumption that all the animals are chickens is incorrect.\nLet's try assuming that all the animals are cows. Since cows have 4 legs each, there would be a total of 20 * 4 = 80 legs.\nHowever, we know that there are actually 70 legs in total. This means that there must be some chickens on the farm.\nSince chickens have 2 legs each, we can subtract the number of legs from the cows from the total number of legs to find the number of legs from the chickens.\n70 - 80 = -10\nSince we cannot have a negative number of legs, we know that our initial assumption that all the animals are cows is incorrect.\nTherefore, we can conclude that there are 15 chickens on the farm.\nThe answer is 15"]}
