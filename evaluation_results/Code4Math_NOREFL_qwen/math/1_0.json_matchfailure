This quadratic has two solutions, $a = 2$ and $a = 3$. So, we have two pairs $(2,2)$ and $(3,3)$.\nIf $a \\neq b$, then we can divide both sides of the equation $(a - b)(a + b) = 5a - 4b$ by $a - b$ to get $a + b = 5 - \\frac{4b}{a - b}$. Since $a$ and $b$ are complex numbers, the right-hand side is a rational function of $b$. Therefore, the left-hand side must also be a rational function of $b$. This means that $a + b$ is a rational function of $b$. Since $a$ and $b$ are complex numbers, this means that $a + b$ is a constant. Let's call this constant $c$. Then, we have $a + b = c$ for all pairs $(a,b)$.\nSubstituting this into the first equation, we get $a + \\frac{10b}{a^2 + b^2} = 5$, which simplifies to $a^2 + b^2 = 5a - 10b$. Since $a + b = c$, we can substitute $a = c - b$ into this equation to get $(c - b)^2 + b^2 = 5(c - b) - 10b$. Expanding and simplifying, we get $2b^2 - 2cb + c^2 - 5c + 10b = 0$. This is a quadratic equation in $b$, so it has two solutions. Let's call these solutions $b_1$ and $b_2$. Then, we have $a_1 = c - b_1$ and $a_2 = c - b_2$. So, the sum of all the $a$'s and $b$'s is $a_1 + b_1 + a_2 + b_2 = (c - b_1) + b_1 + (c - b_2) + b_2 = 2c$.\nTherefore, the sum of all the $a$'s and $b$'s is $2c$. Since we found two pairs $(2,2)$ and $(3,3)$, we have $c = 2 + 2 = 4$ or $c = 3 + 3 = 6$. So, the sum of all the $a$'s and $b$'s is $2c = 2(4) = \\boxed{8}$ or $2(6) = \\boxed{12}$.\nThe answer is 8"]}
