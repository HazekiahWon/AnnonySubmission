{"version": "fail_grading_match", "details": [["192"], "72", ["192"], "Let's reason step by step.\nThe volume of each box is calculated by multiplying the length, width, and height. So, the volume of each box is 5 inches * 6 inches * 4 inches = 120 cubic inches.\nSince John has 3 boxes, the total inner volume of all 3 boxes is 120 cubic inches * 3 = 360 cubic inches.\nHowever, we need to subtract the volume of the walls. The walls are 1 inch thick, so we need to subtract the volume of the walls from the total volume.\nThe volume of the walls is calculated by multiplying the length, width, and thickness of the walls. So, the volume of the walls for each box is (5 inches + 2 inches) * (6 inches + 2 inches) * 1 inch = 7 inches * 8 inches * 1 inch = 56 cubic inches.\nSince John has 3 boxes, the total volume of the walls is 56 cubic inches * 3 = 168 cubic inches.\nTherefore, the total inner volume of all 3 boxes is 360 cubic inches - 168 cubic inches = 192 cubic inches.\nThe answer is $\\boxed{192}$."]}

"Let's reason step by step.\nThe original price of the bag of marbles is $20.\nAfter 2 months, the price increases by 20% of $20, which is $20 * 0.20 = $4.\nSo, after 2 months, the price of the bag of marbles is $20 + $4 = $24.\nAfter 4 months, the price increases by 20% of $24, which is $24 * 0.20 = $4.80.\nSo, after 4 months, the price of the bag of marbles is $24 + $4.80 = $28.80.\nAfter 6 months, the price increases by 20% of $28.80, which is $28.80 * 0.20 = $5.76.\nSo, after 6 months, the price of the bag of marbles is $28.80 + $5.76 = $34.56.\nAfter 36 months, the price increases by 20% of the original price every two months, so the price will have increased 36/2 = 18 times.\nTherefore, the final price of the bag of marbles after 36 months is $20 * (1 + 0.20)^18 = $20 * 2.613136352 = $20 *

{"version": "fail_grading_match", "details": [["0"], "16", ["0"], "Let's reason step by step.\nLet's denote the daily recommended cups of coffee as C. According to the problem, Octavia drinks half of this amount, which is C/2.\n\nJuan, on the other hand, drinks 10 times the amount of coffee that Octavia drinks. So, Juan drinks 10 * (C/2) = 5C.\n\nJuan's doctor has asked him to reduce his coffee intake to the daily recommendation of 4 cups. This means that Juan needs to reduce his daily coffee intake by 5C - 4 cups.\n\nTo find the value of C, we can set up an equation based on the information given in the problem. Since Juan's doctor has asked him to reduce his coffee intake to 4 cups, we can set up the equation:\n\n5C - 4 = 4\n\nSolving this equation for C, we get:\n\n5C = 8\nC = 8/5\n\nHowever, since we are dealing with the number of cups, we can't have a fraction of a cup. This means that the problem is inconsistent and cannot be solved with the given information.\n\nBut, if we assume that the problem is actually about how many cups Juan needs to reduce his daily coffee intake, we can continue with the calculation.\n\nJuan currently drinks 5C cups of coffee, and the daily recommendation is 4 cups. So, he needs to reduce his daily coffee intake by 5C - 4 cups.\n\nSubstituting C = 4/5 into the equation, we get:\n\nJuan needs to reduce his daily coffee intake by 5 * (4/2) - 4 = 10 - 4 = 20/10 - 8/10 = 10 - 4 = 4/10 - 20/10 = 4/20 = 1/20\n\n/20/10/0000/0000/0000/0000/0000/0000/0000/0000/0000/0000/0000/0000/0000/0000/0000/0000/0000/0000/0000/0000/0000/0000/0000/0000/0000/0000/0000/0000/0000/0000/0000/0000/0000/0000/0000/0000/0000/0000/0000/0000/0000/0000/0000/0/000/000/000/000/00/00/000/00/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/"]}

So, the total number of fish in his pond after buying the white fish is 7 + W.\n\nThe problem also states that the number of orange fish is twice the number of white fish. So, the number of orange fish is 2W.\n\nThe total number of fish in the pond after adding the white fish is equal to the number of white fish plus the number of orange fish, which is W + 2W = 3W.\n\nThe problem also states that the sales assistant at the pet shop dipped out 17 fish out of a mixed tank of both white and orange fish. So, the total number of fish in the pond after adding the white fish is equal to the number of white fish plus the number of orange fish, which is 7 + 17 = 24.\n\nSetting up the equation 3W = 24, we can solve for W by dividing both sides of the equation by 3. \n\nSo, W = 24 / 3 = 8.\n\nTherefore, Bob bought $\\boxed{8}$ white fish at the store."]}

We do this by dividing the total length of the flower bed by the width of each flower plus the space between each flower. So, 1332 inches / (12 inches + 18 inches) = 1332 inches / 30 inches = 44.4\nSince we can't have a fraction of a flower, we round up to the nearest whole number, which is 45 flowers.\nWe know that Pat already has 17 flowers, so she needs to buy 45 flowers - 17 flowers = 28 flowers.\nSince each flower costs $6, Pat will spend 28 flowers * $6/flower = $168 at the store to fill up her flower bed.\nThe answer is $\\boxed{168}$."]}

The remaining flights are split equally between flights to France and flights to Germany, so each of these countries receives (F - 3F/4)/2 = F/8 flights.\n\nThe other plane flies exclusively to Poland, and its 44 trips only amount to half the number of trips the first plane makes throughout each day.

"Let's reason step by step.\nOn the first race, Johnny's dad lost $5.\nOn the second race, he won $1 more than twice the amount he previously lost, so he won 2*$5 + $1 = $11.\nOn the third race, he lost 1.5 times as much as he won in the second race, so he lost 1.5*$11 = $16.50.\nTo find the average amount he lost, we need to add up the amounts he lost in each race and divide by the number of

The amount of heat in the water is proportional to its temperature, so the decrease in temperature is proportional to the amount of water poured out. Therefore, the temperature of the water in the mug after pouring is 33 - (4/total_water) * (33 - 40). \n\nSimilarly, when he pours 1 ounce of water from the second mug into his water bottle, the temperature of the water in the mug decreases. The temperature of the water in the mug after pouring is x - (1/total_water) * (x - 40).\n\nSince he is now able to drink the water, the temperature of the water in both mugs is at least 40 degrees. Therefore, we have the following equation:\n\n33 - (4/total_water) * (33 - 40) >= 40\nx - (1/total_water) * (x - 40) >= 40\n\nSolving the first equation for x gives:\n\n33 - (4/total_water) * (-7) >= 40\n33 + (28/total_water) >= 40\n28/total_water >= 7\ntotal_water >= 4\n\nSolving the second equation for x gives:\n\nx - (1/4) * (x - 40) >= 40\n(3/4) * x >= 40 + 10\n(3/4) * x >= 50\nx >= 200/3\nx >= 66.67\n\nTherefore, the temperature of the second mug is at least 60 degrees.\n\nSo the answer is $\\boxed{60}$."]}
