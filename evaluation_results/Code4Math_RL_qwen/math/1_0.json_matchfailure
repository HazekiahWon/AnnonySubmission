Since they are tangent to the $xy$-plane, the radius is equal to the $z$-coordinate of the center of the sphere. So the radii of the spheres are 4, 4, and 5, respectively.\nThe second plane is tangent to all three spheres, so it is equidistant from the centers of the spheres. Let's call the distance from the plane to the center of the first sphere $d_1$, to the center of the second sphere $d_2$, and to the center of the third sphere $d_3$. Then we have the following equations:\n$d_1 = 4$\n$d_2 = 4$\n$d_3 = 5$\nThe equation of the plane can be written as $ax + by + cz = d$. Since the plane is tangent to all three spheres, the distance from the plane to the center of each sphere is equal to the radius of the sphere.

Therefore, the equation of the plane is $ax + ax - 2a - 6a = -5a$, or $2ax - 8a = -5a$. Dividing both sides by $a$, we get $2x - 8 = -5$, so $x = \\frac{3}{2}$.

We can then use the Pythagorean identity $\\sin^2 x + \\cos^2 x = 1$ to simplify this to $49 + 98\\sin x + 49\\sin^2 x = 484 - 484\\sin^2 x$. This simplifies to $533\\sin^2 x + 98\\sin x - 435 = 0$. We can then solve this quadratic equation to get $\\sin x = \\frac{-98 \\pm \\sqrt{98^2 - 4(533)(-435)}}{2(533)}$. We can then use the fact that $\\sin x$ is positive in the first and second quadrants to get $\\sin x = \\frac{-98 + \\sqrt{98^2 - 4(533)(-435)}}{2(533)}$. We can then use the fact that $\\csc x = \\frac{1}{\\sin x}$ and $\\cot x = \\frac{\\cos x}{\\sin x}$ to get $\\csc x + \\cot x = \\frac{1}{\\sin x} + \\frac{\\cos x}{\\sin x} = \\frac{1 + \\cos x}{\\sin x}$. We can then use the fact that $\\cos x = \\sqrt{1 - \\sin^2 x}$ to get $\\csc x + \\cot x = \\frac{1 + \\sqrt{1 - \\sin^2 x}}{\\sin x}$. We can then substitute the value of $\\sin x$ that we found earlier to get $\\csc x + \\cot x = \\frac{1 + \\sqrt{1 - \\left(\\frac{-98 + \\sqrt{98^2 - 4(533)(-435)}}{2(533)}\\right)^2}}{\\frac{-98 + \\sqrt{98^2 - 4(533)(-435)}}{2(533)}}$.
