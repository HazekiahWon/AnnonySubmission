So, we can write this as:\n\nS = C - 2\n\nSubstituting the value of S from the first equation into the second equation, we get:\n\n20 = C - 2\n\nSolving for C, we add 2 to both sides of the equation:\n\n20 + 2 = C\n\nSo, C = 22.

{"version": "fail_grading_match", "details": [["131"], "5", ["131"], "Let's break down the problem into smaller parts and solve it step by step.\n\nFirst, we know that Kelly has 5 packs of bacon and each pack costs $10. So, the total cost of the bacon is 5 * $10 = $50.\n\nNext, we know that each packet of chicken costs twice as much as a pack of bacon. Since each pack of bacon costs $10, each packet of chicken costs 2 * $10 = $20. Kelly has 6 packets of chicken, so the total cost of the chicken is 6 * $20 = $120.\n\nWe also know that Kelly has 3 packs of strawberries, each costing $4. So, the total cost of the strawberries is 3 * $4 = $12.\n\nLastly, we know that each pack of apples costs half the price of a pack of strawberries. Since each pack of strawberries costs $4, each pack of apples costs $4 / 2 = $2. Kelly has 7 packs of apples, so the total cost of the apples is 7 * $2 = $14.\n\nNow, let's add up the total cost of all the items: $50 (bacon) + $120 (chicken) + $12 (strawberries) + $14 (apples) = $196.\n\nKelly's budget is $65. To find out how much money she has left, we subtract the total cost of the items from her budget: $65 - $196 = -$131.\n\nHowever, since the result is negative, it means that Kelly's budget is not enough to buy all the items in her cart. She would have $131 left if she had enough money in her budget.\n\nSo the answer is $\\boxed{131}$."]}

According to the problem, she mowed Kamala's lawn thrice as many times as Joe's, so we can denote the number of times she mowed Kamala's lawn as 3J. Similarly, she mowed Alba's lawn five times as many times as Joe's, so we can denote the number of times she mowed Alba's lawn as 5J.\n\nThe total amount Tasha earned from mowing lawns is the sum of the money she earned from mowing Joe's, Kamala's, and Alba's lawns. We know that Joe paid Tasha $6 for her work, so the total amount Tasha earned from mowing lawns is 6J + 6*3J + 6*5J = 6J + 18J + 30J = 54J.\n\nWe also know that Tasha made $80 from selling lemonade and mowing lawns. Since the total amount Tasha made is the sum of the money she made from lemonade sales and mowing lawns, we can write the equation 54J + L = 80, where L represents the amount Tasha made from lemonade sales.\n\nTo find the amount Tasha made from lemonade sales, we need to solve the equation for L. We can do this by subtracting 54J from both sides of the equation: L = 80 - 54J.\n\nSince we know that Joe paid Tasha $6 for her work, we can substitute J = 6 into the equation: L = 80 - 54*6 = 80 - 324 = -244.\n\nHowever, the result is negative, which doesn't make sense in the context of the problem.
